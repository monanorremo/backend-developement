        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
        recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
        leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely Mountain.
                Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the
                Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
                point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained
                the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
                Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
                the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a brown-hooded
                cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined
                with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the
                Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were
                usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He fought in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies,
                and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <h3>Glóin</h3>
            <p>Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the Dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin and younger
                brother of Óin.
            
                In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of the Dwarves
                and Orcs, though it is unknown what significance he did, being 16 years old.
            
                In TA 2879, in the Blue Mountains, while in exile, his son Gimli was born to him and an unknown wife. In March of TA
                2941 in Bree, Thorin Oakenshield met by chance the wizard Gandalf the Grey, pushing Thorin to reclaim Erebor, so
                that Smaug wouldn't start an alliance with Sauron. When Gandalf mentioned hobbits, Glóin referred them as
                "simpletons" and also said that hobbits "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet
                new from the shell".
